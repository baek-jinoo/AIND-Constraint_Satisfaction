In this exercise you will explore Constraint Satisfaction Problems by implementing the N-Queens problem using symbolic constraints in a Jupyter notebook, and solving it using the Backtracking Search algorithm from AIMA.

To launch the notebook, run the following command from a terminal with anaconda3 installed and on the application path:

    jupyter notebook AIND-Constraint_Satisfaction.ipynb

Notes by Jin:

You can run this by setting up anaconda with an environment that installs the imported modules shown in the jupyter notebook


### Backtracking Algorithm

Implemented the backtracking search algorithm in the AIMA textbook

#### Optimizations

Also added the most restricted variable search as part of the backtracking search process
Ordering with most count to optimize the constraint satisfaction process

mrv
least constraining value
MAC
Used unit tests to validate the optimizations


### Image of outcome (TODO)
